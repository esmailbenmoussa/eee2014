# Description
The eee-days is the largest career fair for business administration and economics students in the Nordic region, and we dare to say it is the best one as well! Whether you are looking for some networking with interesting companies, listening to exciting speakers or sitting down with your dream employer for a one on one conversation, eee is the place for you.

The eee days was started way back in 1984 when the student union EfsilEkonomerna (one of the predecessors of LundaEkonomerna) felt that there was a need for a new forum where students and businesses could meet. They named it EfsilEkonomernas Ekonomdagar, eee, and begun creating something that eventually grew into the highlight of the student year at LUSEM

This year we will celebrate the 30th anniversary of eee. We have a team of seventeen committee members that are working on making this yearâ€™s fair to the best one yet, and we hope that you will join the celebrations in February!
